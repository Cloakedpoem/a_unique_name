#I added alt attributes to all the images that were in the html code.
#I downloaded the images and place them in the same file with the css code and html so it would link, 
but i don't think it works now that I uploaded it to github. I noticed that I can download the zip file
and the code would launch like that, but I 'm unsure how to get the url for the live page. 
#The only URLs I managed to pull are the github links and the local file on my c drive, but per the 
insructions I wasn't entirely sure on how to get the live version of that web page.
#Wasn't entirely sure how to sync the files on git bash or the terminal in VS studio
